    The temple was once renovated by the Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevarayar. It also houses shrines for Alamelumangai Thayar, Anjaneyar, Garudalvar, Desikar, Rukmini, Satyabhama, and Thirukkachi Nambi. Since this temple was patronised by Krishnadevarayar, there is an idol of his likeness within the sanctum
