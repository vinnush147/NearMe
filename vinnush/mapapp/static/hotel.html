    This is a branch of the famous Murugan Idli shop of Chennai located on the Chennai - Bangalore highway near Kaveripakkam. Though the hotel lay out is good and spacious, the fare is not as tasty as that of the original located in Chennai. But for the brand name, this is not a place I would recommend. Further up after Kancheepuram one can take a halt of Saravana bhavan or a couple of kilometers down there are hotels just before and after the Kaveripakkam toll booth for better food.
